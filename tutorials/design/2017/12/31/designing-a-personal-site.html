		<p>When I first started working on this site, I found the first steps of the process very difficult. How do you reduce yourself into a few words and a layout? How do you express who you are without being self-centered?</p>

<p>Luckily, there are a lot of established design processes for these types of problems. The first is <strong>defining use cases</strong>. Simply put, <em>how do I want my site to be used</em>?</p>

<p>I was mainly focused on a few cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>visitors can find links to my projects/media</li>
  <li>visitors can see my face (somewhere)</li>
  <li>visitors can read about my ideas</li>
</ol>

<p>With these priorities in mind, I started thinking about what I want my first impression to be, and ended up with this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/original-site-banner.png" alt="current banner" /></p>

<p>This came from a variety of motivations. First, I wanted to have a <em>picture of my face</em>, in order to <strong>keep things personal</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="/img/eliasInTheSun.jpg" alt="old picture of me" /></p>

<p>This one is from a <em>long time ago</em> (don’t judge), but I really like the colors in it.</p>

<p>To <em>explain a bit about who I am</em>, I added the <strong>little blurb</strong>, which conveniently <strong>links</strong> to a lot of <em>ME things</em> (like my github and instagram):</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/original-site-banner-blurb.png" alt="site banner blurb" /></p>

<p>it also has a <em>link to my posts</em>, which are just posted below it on the home page. I chose to make it a blog because it would <strong>allow the site to evolve as I learn/consume new things</strong> (okay, also because I wanted to blog).</p>

<p>The background is a picture I took on a trip in Italy that I tinted down to make the blurb easier to read. There’s a <strong>trend</strong> in visual design centered around using more <em>large images</em>, and its valuable to <strong>share a visual language with your peers</strong>, in order to <strong>stay current</strong>.</p>

<p>All together, it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/original-site-banner.png" alt="site banner background" /></p>

<p>That covers the first two things: having links to my projects, and a picture of my face.</p>

<p>Great! Now for expressing my ideas in blog form. What are the use cases here?</p>

<ol>
  <li>visitors can find the posts on google</li>
  <li>visitors can browse a list of posts</li>
</ol>

<p>Because I plan to write about a variety of topics,</p>

<ol>
  <li>visitors can browse a list of posts with a certain topic</li>
</ol>

<p>And because of my goal of expanding my online presence</p>

<ol>
  <li>visitors can subscribe to my blog</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>I’ll write more about SEO</strong> and <strong>building a blog with jekyll</strong> in a later post, and for now, we’ll <em>focus on design</em>. Let’s start with the list of posts:</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/post-link-image.png" alt="post entry" /></p>

<p>I decided to have the list of posts on the home page, so that visitors can get straight to the content.</p>

<p>Each post has an image (for visual engagement), and a title/description to show the content. I also added tags so that the user can navigate to similar posts.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/subscription-box.png" alt="subscription box" /></p>

<p>I also added a subscription widget at the bottom of every page, so that I can grow a base of readers. I’m using <strong>mailchimp to manage the subscription</strong>, which I’ll cover in a later post.</p>

<p>And altogether, I have a personal site that includes a blog and covers the following use cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>visitors can find links to my projects/media</li>
  <li>visitors can see my face (somewhere)</li>
  <li>visitors can read about my ideas</li>
  <li>visitors can browse a list of posts</li>
  <li>visitors can browse a list of posts with a certain topic</li>
  <li>visitors can subscribe to my blog</li>
</ol>
