This is the start of a _hopefully_ **wonderful** series of posts that will include reflections on the media (films, books, and others) that I consume, software development tutorials based on my own notes, and potentially other _musings_ (do the italics make using that word less pretentious?).

I'll add this in my about page, but here is a little about me to kick things off:

(As of December 2017,) I am a software developer with a passion for making things, living in Boston and working for a great software security company called Symantec. I don't write as much as I should, and I read/watch movies a lot more instead. My time is spend running or indoor climbing, or working on my pet projects. You can find some of them on my github.
